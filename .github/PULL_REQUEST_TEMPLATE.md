<details>
<summary>Slash-m GmbH Software Grant and Contributor License Agreement</summary>

This agreement is based on the Apache Software Foundation Contributor License Agreement. (v r190612)

Thank you for your interest in the cytario-web project stewarded by Slash-m GmbH ("Slash-m"). In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, Slash-m must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been agreed to by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Slash-m and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

**1. Definitions**

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Slash-m. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.

"Contribution" shall mean any work, as well as any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Slash-m for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Slash-m (the "Work").

**2. Grant of Copyright License**

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Slash-m and to recipients of software distributed by Slash-m a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

**3. Grant of Patent License**

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Slash-m and to recipients of software distributed by Slash-m a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) were submitted.

**4. Authority**

You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If You are an individual, and if Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes Your Contributions, you represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that Your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to Slash-m.

**5. Contributions**

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).

**6. Disclaimers**

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND.

**7. Third Party Contributions**

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Slash-m separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".
